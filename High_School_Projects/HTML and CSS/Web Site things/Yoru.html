        <h4>Description</h4>

        <div class="Yoru Description">
            <p class = "Yoru2">Yoru is undeniably arrogant, and is known to be easily annoyed and irritated by people, including his own teammates. He operates mostly as a lone wolf, preferring to take down entire enemy teams on his own and has initially shown to cooperate with his team only out of reluctance, but over time he would go on to be a team player. Being the powerful rift walker that he is, Yoru thinks quite highly of himself and his abilities, always looking down on his enemies and referring to them as "minnows" - nothing more than small fish. Such thoughts have also been seen in action, being able to put down up to twenty enemies at once all on his own. Though some of these actions are seen as heroic by passers-by when used to bring order to the streets, Yoru himself dislikes being considered a savior or a hero for what he does.</p>
